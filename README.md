# VT-tools
### I-24 MOTION analytics code for speed field and virtual trajectory computation
#### Version: 1.0
#### Last updated: 2024-02-09

## Requirements

VT-tools can be run as stand-alone code or as part of your own analysis. The requirements for running the code are as follows:
- Python 3.10
- Supporting libraries enumerated in `requirements.txt`.
- *Note: if you are only importing VT-tools for use in other code and do not need the Python notebook it comes with, the Jupyter library is not required.

We recommend starting with a clean Python environment (i.e., through Conda or venv) with the correct Python version. The supporting libraries can then be installed by activating/entering your Python environment and running the following command from the VT-tools directory `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
